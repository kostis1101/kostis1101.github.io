                In 2018 I got into game development using Unity. This lead to me creating a game called "United Squares" about a year later. It's a very simple 2D-Game where you have to fight an enemy who get's increasingly more powerful. At you disposal you have two types of weapons, a normal "gun" and a grenade and you can also build to protect yourself. The goal is to survive the longest and collect as many points as possible. The music was created by a good friend of mine that at that time was into music production. You can find him <a href="https://www.instagram.com/horizonmusiic/">here</a>.<br>
                I currently don't have any downloads available <star-nodes>Why would anyone want it?</star-nodes>, but you can enjoy a primitive (i.e. the kind that you would expect from a young teen) trailer I created back then on <a href="https://youtu.be/7sCFoSg7Z0Q">youtube</a>.
