			This is the second (and so far last) game I ever finished. This was the result of my participation in the Weekly Game Jam - Week 146 (which was around April 2020). The theme of the jam was "Mountain Climber". I created a 2D game in Unity, were the player has to "climb" a hill while having to avoid touching on the small and large "rocks" that are being randomly drops towards them. They have the ability to double jump and "dash", each with a cool down. Everything was created by myself, apart from the music, which was created by a close friend of mine. You can find the game on itch.io <a href="https://dimension-games.itch.io/hill-runner">here</a>.
