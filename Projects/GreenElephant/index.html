            When I was younger I was kind of obsessed with complex numbers, so I through of creating some sort of library that would implement complex numbers and the respective functions. At first I was planing on implementing only very basic complex arithmetic, but I ended up creating much more. The only language I new that the time was C# (and not well at all), so that's what I worked with. <br> Working on the project helped me understand complex number and there behaviour much better and allowed me to build a strong intuition, as I was actively trying to understand how complex numbers work from an geometric and algorithmic point of view (e.g. what does taking a logarithm do to a complex number and how do I tell the computer to compute that?). <br>
            You can find the result on <a href="https://github.com/kostis1101/Green-Elephant">github</a>.
