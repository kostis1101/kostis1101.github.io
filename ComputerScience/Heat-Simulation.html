                I recently wrote a heat equation simulation. I mainly followed <a href="https://youtu.be/KrdO-6B8Stg?list=PLAZp3rbgWLo1ZKxqNzl04oaQhpbv_5mg9">a lecture of Niels Berglund</a>. I wrote the programme in C++ and used opencv for saving the frames to the disc.

            <h3>The heat equation</h3>
            <p>
                The heat equation is the following second order partial differential equation (for the 2D case):
                \[
                    \partial_t u = \alpha\Delta u
                \]
                where u is the temperature. <br>
                Let \(u_{t, x, y}\) be the temperature at time \(t\) and point \((x, y)\). Since the indices get messy fast, we will only show the ones that are changing (e.g. we will write \(u_{y + \Delta y}\) instead of \(u_{t, x, y + \Delta y}\)). To discretize the equation, we set a small time and space step \(\Delta t\) and \(\Delta s\). The partial derivative in terms of space and time can be approximated as follows:
                \[
                    \begin{flalign*}
                        &\qquad\bullet\quad \partial_t u \approx \frac{u_{t + \Delta t} - u_t}{\Delta t} && \\
                        &\qquad\bullet\quad \partial_{xx} u \approx \frac{u_{x + \Delta x} + u_{x - \Delta x} - 2 u_x}{\Delta x} && \\
                        &\qquad\bullet\quad \partial_{yy} u \approx \frac{u_{y + \Delta y} + u_{y - \Delta y} - 2 u_{y}}{\Delta x}
                    \end{flalign*}
                \]
                Applying the heat equation and solving for \(u_{t + \Delta t, x, y}\) we have:
                \[
                    u_{t + \Delta t} = u + \frac{\alpha\Delta t}{\Delta x^2} \left(u_{x + \Delta x} + u_{x - \Delta x} + u_{y + \Delta y} + u_{y - \Delta y} - 4 u\right)
                \]
                For more details and an in-depth explanation (and because it is really interesting) watch Nils Berglund's video.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Implementation</h3>
            <p>
                I found that for relatively big values of \(\frac{\alpha\Delta t}{\Delta x^2}\), having one 2D array and applying the simulation on it every time step produced unstable results. There are ways to increase stability there, but I want with the easy and lazy way of creating two 2D arrays, one holding the temperature values from the previous time step and the other for the next. In other words, I used the data from the array with the previous values to calculate the data for the array with the next values. To avoid copying the data from one array to the other every time step, the roles of each array are simply switch every time step.

                When it comes to boundary conditions, there is a lot one can do. The simplest form is a perfect insulating simulation, there the heat is trapped in the simulation world and cannot escape it. This is achieved by setting the temperature of cell right outside the boundary cell equal to the temperature of that boundary cell. Another idea is to keep the temperature of same of the boundary cells constant. This is like "heating" or "cooling" a plate from outside by touching a heating or cooling source with constant temperature. A mixture of the above mentioned boundary conditions is the following simulation: <br>

                <br>
                Another possibility is to use periodic boundary conditions. The following is the result of having two hot and two cold plates exchanging heat with periodic boundary conditions: <br>
