        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Geometric proof of the formula for Euler's Totient Function</h2>

        <div class="math_text">
            <br>
            <p>
                We are going to prove the well known formula for Euler's Totient Function: \(\phi(n) = n\prod_{p_i}\left(1 - \frac{1}{p_i}\right)\), where \(p_i\) are the distinct prime factors of \(n\).
            </p>
            <p>
                To prove the result, we need to prove two things first: One, that \(\phi(p^k) = p^k\left(1 - \frac{1}{p}\right)\) for all prime powers \(p^k\) and two, that \(\phi(ab) = \phi(a)\phi(b)\) whenever \(\gcd(a, b) = 1\). From now on the gcd is going to be written as simple parenthesis: \((a, b) = 1\).
            </p>
            <p>
                The first of the two lemmas is quite easy to prove algebraically. In this case we will concern ourself with the second lemma, which we are going to prove geometrically.
            </p>
            
            <br>
            <h3>Geometric Proof of the second lemma</h3>
            <p>
                We want to prove that if \((a, b) = 1\) then \(\phi(ab) = \phi(a)\phi(b)\). Remainder that \(\phi(n)\) counts the amount of numbers that are coprime to \(n\) that are smaller or equal to \(n\). The idea is to map all natural numbers from \(1\) to \(ab\) to lattice points in a 2-dimensional space such that it is easy to then count the numbers that are coprime to \(ab\). The mapping itself is quite simple: Every number \(m \in \{1, 2, ..., ab\}\) will be mapped to \((x, y)\), where \(0 \leq x < a\), \(0 \leq y < b\) and the following system if satisfied:
                \[
                    \begin{cases}
                        m \equiv x \pmod{a} \\
                        m \equiv y \pmod{b}
                    \end{cases}
                \]
                In other words, \(x\) is the remainder of \(m : a\) and \(y\) thee remainder of \(m : b\).
            </p>
            <p>
                Now observe the following: For every natural number \(m\), \((m, ab) = 1\) if and only if \((m, a) = 1\) and \((m, b) = 1\). But \((m, a) = (x, a)\) and \((m, b) = (y, b)\). Thus \((m, ab) = 1\) if and only if \((x, a) = 1\) and \((y, b) = 1\). Taking the contraposition of the previous equivalence, this tells us that \((m, ab) > 1\) if and only if either \((x, a) > 1\) or \((y, b) > 1\). Now taking all the points in the \(a \times b\) lattice, we want to remove all those points that correspond to numbers \(m\) that are not coprimes to \(ab\). But if \(m\) is not coprime to \(ab\), then at least one of the coordinates of that corresponding point \((x, y)\) will be not coprime to \(a\) or \(b\) respectively. So, instead of removing all points whose corresponding number is not coprime to \(ab\), we can equivalently remove all points \((x, y)\) for which either \(x\) is not coprime to \(a\) or y is not coprime to \(b\) (or both of course). This will result in removing whole rows and columns from the lattice.
            </p>
            <p>
                But how many rows and columns do we remove? Well, lets focus on columns first. A column consists of points with the same x-coordinate. The column will be removed if this shared x-coordinate is not coprime to \(a\). But, there are a total of \(\phi(a)\) numbers between \(0\) and \(a - 1\) that are coprime to \(a\). So the rest are not corpime to \(a\) and so the respective columns with that x-coordinate will be removed. This means that in total \(a - \phi(a)\) columns will be removed, and \(\phi(a)\) will remain. Applying the same logic to the y-axis, where we work \(\bmod{b}\), the rows that will be removed are \(b - \phi(b)\), and so there will be \(\phi(b)\) rows remaining.
            </p>
            <p>
                After the removing procedure, we are left with \(\phi(b)\) rows and \(\phi(a)\) columns of points. As we've seen already, these points correspond to exactly all numbers between \(1\) and \(ab\) that are coprime to \(ab\). And since these are organized in \(\phi(a)\) columns and \(\phi(b)\) rows, the total number of remaining points, and thus the total number of coprime integers between \(1\) and \(ab\), is \(\phi(a)\phi(b)\). Thus proving that \(\phi(ab) = \phi(a)\phi(b)\).
            </p>

            <br>
            <h3>A small oversight</h3>
            <p>
                The proof is quite elegant, don't you think? Well, it turns out it is wrong. Or at least incomplete. Remember, \(\phi(ab) = \phi(a)\phi(b)\) only in the case that \((a, b) = 1\). But in the above proof we never use that \((a, b) = 1\) and still came to the conclusion that \(\phi(ab) = \phi(a)\phi(b)\). Try to find where we made the mistake.
            </p>
            <p>
                Well, the problem lies in the mapping. When we remove points from the lattice we assume that every point corrisponds to a single number. In other words, we assume that the mapping is one-to-one. This is actually generally not the case. For example, for \(a = 6\) and \(b = 4\), there are no numbers that map to the point \((1, 2)\). If there exists a \(m\) that mapped to \((1, 2)\) then that would mean that:
                \[
                    \begin{cases}
                        m \equiv 1 \mod{6} \ \Longrightarrow\ 6 \ | \ (m - 1) \ \Longrightarrow\ 2 \ | \ (m - 1) \\
                        m \equiv 2 \mod{4} \ \Longrightarrow\ 4 \ | \ (m - 2) \ \Longrightarrow\ 2 \ | \ (m - 2)
                    \end{cases}
                \]
                which is of course impossible.
            </p>
            <p>
                It turns out that the mapping is one-to-one only in the case that \((a, b) = 1\). This can be prooven using the Chinese remainder theorem. For every point \((x, y)\) in the \(a \times b\) lattice (that is for every point with \(0 \leq x < a\) and \(0 \leq y < b\)) the system of modulo equivalences
                \[
                    \begin{cases}
                        m \equiv x \mod{a} \\
                        m \equiv y \mod{b}
                    \end{cases}
                \]
                has a single solution for \(m\) in the range \(0 \leq m < ab\), or equivalently in the range \(1 \leq m \leq ab\). Thus the mapping described above is one-to-one if \((a, b) = 1\). This completes the proof.
